AutoRefresh

This extension allows you to auto reload a page. There are two modes

- Until Success: reloads until the server gives a HTTP 200 response (for a server outage or overage)
- Timed: reloads every X seconds/minutes (to keep a tab current. useful for a dedicated screen or kiosk showing a feed)
